So there I was, minding my own business, eating my apfelkuchen.
Out of nowhere, a man wearing lederhose approached me.
"Have you seen a black hund around here by any chance?" He said.
"I did see one, although it was in Berlin... or perhaps was it Raesfeld? I can never tell them appart", I answered.
This answer was not what I expected so I continued on my way to the Biergarten listening to Rammstein's Deutchland.
